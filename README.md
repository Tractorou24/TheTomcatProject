TheTomcatProject is a F-14B 1:1 Replica Simulator, consisting of a physical structure and electrical/software interfaces to a PC to be driven by Digital Combat Simulator (DCS).

Currently, this repo reflects the project in its current state and is not 100% functional, and all items are subject to change.

## Mechanical and Electrical Models

The MCAD and the ECAD is from SOLIDWORKS 2022. No models for contribution will be accepted in anything except this format so we don't end up with various components in various software packages and increase the dependencies required. No commits from the educational or makers versions will be accepted.
